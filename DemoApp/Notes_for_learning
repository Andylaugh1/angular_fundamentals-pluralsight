1. When setting up the server using IIS I had to make sure that WAS and World Wide Publishing Service were both turned on and running. This can be done rom teh search bar and 'turn windows features on or off'
2. Even once this is done, an error can occur relating to permissions. To avoid this, in IIS, you have to go to the basic settings and ake sure your user is allocated as the specific user (with machine account username and password)

About AngularJs:
- Controllers and Scope: Controllers primary resp is to create the scope object
- The scope is not the model - the data on the scope is the model

Directives basically teach HTML new tricks
Directives can be written out as tags, attributes and as classes:
<ng-form />
<div ng-form />
<div class="ng-form" />

Never manipulate the DOM from within a controller (ie using jquery in the controller to hide something or show something. This should always be done using directives and binding

Ngcloak - angular will hide portions of your page until certain things have had a chance to run
- this helps us avoid a flash of unbound HTML

Using ng-form you can have nested forms

Angular Filters: modifying output, formatting, sorting data, filtering data. example: {{ expression | filter}}
 - built in filters include: uppercase, time, numbers, lowercase, date, currency, json, some ng-repeats(orderby, limitTo, filter)
 
 Writing custom filters: take an existing module and call the filter function on it:
  module.filter('name', function() {
    return function(inout /*, filter parameters */) {
       // modify input
       return modifiedOutput
    }
  });
  
  
 Two Way Binding:
 Using ngModel directive.: input, select, textarea
